        Hello! I'm currently a student at Ada Developers Academy in Seattle.  Previously I worked in Los Angeles at an e-commerce startup. I grew up in southeastern Massachusetts, attended college in Providence, RI, and lived in Boston for two years after college before moving to LA.  I love Boston Terriers, yoga, and dancing to hip-hop and gangsta rap.
